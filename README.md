Your Mission  

We're going to create a photo gallery application which allows users to view their albums as well as the individual photos contained within. We'll implement this as a single page application (SPA). Use the following wireframes as layout inspiration: Album View

Explore Mode  

Challenge #1.1: Use your HTML & CSS knowledge to create the initial layouts for the SPA. Make sure you follow along with the wireframes above. Place your HTML in a file called index.html and your CSS in a file called styles.css. Include any pictures you use in a directory called images.

Challenge #1.2: Now that you've built the site layout, let's use React to make it dynamic. Make sure you can switch between your List, Album & Photo views without reloading the page. Clicking an Album should load a list of the photos, and clicking the photos should open them individually full-screen for viewing. Call your Javascript file app.js. Make sure you have a minimum of 6 photo albums with at least 3 photos each.

Challenge #1.3: Don't forget your version control! Create a local git repository, add your work to it, and upload it to Github.
